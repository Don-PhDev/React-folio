              Hello! My full name is Don Forrest Usbal
              <br />
              I love creating things for the web.
              <br />
              I've been programming since I was 16 years old,
              <br />
              and up until now, my enjoyment and excitement
              <br />
              seeing my programs work hasn't changed.
              <br />
              <br />
              I've strived to learn and improve my skills every day,
              <br />
              pulling numerous all-nighters.
              <br />
              I gain the most satisfaction and confidence
              <br />
              when challenged, and for that reason,
              <br />
              I continually pushed myself to do things
              <br />
              I'd never accomplished before.
              <br />I still have a lot to improve (for example,
              <br />
              if you have constructive criticism or suggestion
              <br />
              about this website, I'd be glad to hear that ðŸ¤—).
