              <p>I love creating things for the web.</p>
              <p>I've been programming since I was 16 years old,
              and up until now, my enjoyment and excitement
              seeing my programs work hasn't changed.</p>
              <p>I've strived to learn and improve my skills every day,
              pulling numerous all-nighters.</p>
              I gain the most satisfaction and confidence
              when challenged, and for that reason,
              I continually pushed myself to do things
              I'd never accomplished before.
              I still have a lot to improve (for example,
              if you have constructive criticism or suggestion
              about this website, I'd be glad to hear that ðŸ¤—).
